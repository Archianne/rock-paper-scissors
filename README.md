# Rock, Paper, Scissors (Lizard and Spock!)
This is a checkpoint challenge I've done with [@SchoolOfCode](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/), where the user can play a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. I've refactored this game to improve JavaScript, implement Sass and add 2 more options: Lizard and Spock (Yes, the game that is played in 'The Big Bang Theory'!)

## How to Play

- "Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors"

### Learnt:
- `document.querySelector()`
- `document.querySelectorAll()`
- `document.getElementById()`
- `element.innerHTML`
- `element.addEventListener()`
- `event.target.innerText`
- `Math.random()`
- `if() else if() else` 

## Refactoring

* Changed from CSS to SASS
* Changed design to something more modern-looking
* Improved JavaScript
